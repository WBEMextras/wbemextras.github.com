## Development ##
Github will be used for hosting the website, the source code and the
issue-tracker.

## Reporting issues ##
The Github interface enables users to report issues or discuss improvements
and new features through the issue-tracker at:
<https://github.com/WBEMextras/WBEMextras/issues>

Once reported, one of the contributors can assign it to himself, classify the
issue by tagging it or link it to a specific milestone release. Managing issues
in this manner helps in collaborating, but also provides full transparency to
users and contributors alike.


## Contributing ##
If you are interested in contributing to similar, you can discuss your area
of interest via mail, or you can simply fork the project
on Github, make the modifications and then do a pull-request.

This makes it easy for the project to discuss the changes through the
pull-request, and when accepted to merge the pull-request in the project.
